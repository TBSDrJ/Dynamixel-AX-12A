# Dynamixel-AX-12A

Requires an install of the [Dynamixel SDK](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK) -- thank you Leon!!!
I am using the Python libraries, downloaded June 19, 2020, and Python 3.6.9 on Ubuntu 18.04.  
I haven't tested it on anything else, but it should be pretty broadly compatible with Python 3 on any platform.

This provides complete controls in a python environment for the Dynamixel AX-12A.

I set up methods for every memory address, read any of them, write any of the writeable ones, all by name.

I set up some shortcuts also: wheel mode, poses.  I'll try to document more soon.
